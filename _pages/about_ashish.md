Hi! I'm Ashish, a Data Science Master's student at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth. I have a background in electrical engineering and software development. I excel in developing enterprise AI based web applications and have worked on several projects in robotics and machine learning on the side.

My interests include Medical AI, robotics, and natural language processing. When I'm not locked in, I nerd out over retro technology, music, gaming and art.
