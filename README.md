# Ashish's Portfolio

**Site Link**: [Here](https://ashishmathew0297.github.io/)

This portfolio site was made from a fork of the [alshedivat/al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) which has been used by many students and academics alike for various purposes. It is highly customizable, and with a bit of effort and motivation to learn something new (particularly Ruby, Jekyll/Liquid, Markdown, Latex, SCSS and HTML) it can be made into something either really interesting or REALLY intimidating.

That aside, the point of this blog at the moment (As of mid to late 2024) is to write out/rant about all that I have understood while learning data science and deep learning related topics. I tend to be a bit pedantic and might go on a few tangents while writing out stuff here and this will not necesrily reflect on my academic writing or professional skills.

A lot of the content will focus on applying the theories learned practically and tearing down concepts/systems to their innards whenever possible to understand what is going on. Also, I won't hold back on giving my opinions on tech-related stuff here as most of what I write here is basically what is going on in my head at the time. My opinions will definitely change over time as I adapt to newer concepts, but I will never change the way I write out stuff here as I want it to be as true to who I am as possible.

In the future, I might add more personal, philosophical, or artistic sections based on where I find myself and also based on how much time I can afford to give this portfolio. Till then I hope you have a great time here.

I hope you enjoy this. Feel free to reach out to me for collaborations or offers (wink, wink).
