Though machine learning and deep learning are both subfields of AI and both terms are used interchangeably, they have their own meanings.</p> <p><strong>Machine learning</strong> algorithms are relatively simple models designed to adapt on input data and either find patterns or make decisions on newly provided data.</p> <p><strong>Deep learning</strong> on the other hand, is a branch of machine learning that involves training expansive <em>artificial neural networks (ANNs)</em>. An ANN consists of layers of interconnected nodes called <em>neurons</em> that, together, help process and learn patterns from the input.</p> <p>We often picture AI, deep learning and machine learning as a Venn diagram with AI taking up the outermost layer, machine learning being the intermediate layer, and the innermost layer being deep learning. A more detailed visualization of this can be seen below.</p> <div class="row justify-content-center mt-3"> <div class="col-8 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/AI_domains.jpg" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/AI_domains.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Artificial Intelligence and its Domains </div> <p>Deep learning has not only transformed how we search for content on the internet, but has also found its use in domains such as:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Image Recognition</strong>: Image recognition is one of the most common uses of deep learning, where a model is capable of identifying objects or features in image and video data. This forms the groundwork for several fields such as facial recognition, image classification, automated driving, robotics and several other fields. This domain also has a great amount of overlap in the field of healthcare in terms of medical imaging.</li> <li> <strong>Object Detection</strong>: Object detection is a technique similar to image recognition. Both these techniques are often paired together when being used practically. Object detection is used on a higher level to detect instances and the positions of objects in an image or video, while image recognition is capable of assigning an identity to objects from these sources. E.g. Object detection would detect whether an image contains cats in it along with the number of cats and their positions. Image recognition would be capable of telling us what color or breed of cat is present in the given image.</li> <li> <strong>Natural Language Processing</strong>: This domain is related to creating a way for computers to understand natural human languages in everyday speech. This could be in several forms such as speech, writing or even sign language. Some of the common techniques that show up in this field are sentiment analysis, keyword extraction, translation, text summarization, text generation, etc.</li> <li> <strong>Generative AI</strong>: This domain involves generating various types of context such as text, images and audio, and is one of the most popular applications of deep learning as of the writing of this blog. GenAI has found various uses in boosting human productivity, such as in content creation, data analysis and research. Large Language Models (LLMs) are the most popular applications of GenAI, with active research and development being done in the domain. Some popular LLMs are Llama by Meta, ChatGPT and GPT-4 by OpenAI, and Gemini by Google.</li> </ul> <h1 id="neural-networks">Neural Networks</h1> <p>The basic idea of deep learning is the training of <strong>Neural Networks</strong>. The best way to understand what a neural network is, is to look at a real-life example.</p> <h5 id="scenario-1">Scenario 1</h5> <p>Consider a housing price prediction model where the data at hand consists of the square-foot size of the houses and their prices. We plot these points out taking the square-foot size on the X axis and price on the Y axis.</p> <div class="row justify-content-center mt-3"> <div class="col-8 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/housing_example_1.jpg" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/housing_example_1.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> All the instances of houses plotted by Price vs Square-foot size. </div> <p>Using basic machine learning, the next logical step would be to create a regression or any other suitable model to fit a line or curve that best describes the general trend of the price of the houses with relation to their size. In this case, let us take linear regression as the initial model of choice.</p> <div class="row justify-content-center mt-3"> <div class="col-8 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/housing_example_2.jpg" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/housing_example_2.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> The linear regression line plotted to fit the points. Note the line taking up negative price values. </div> <p>Now, we know that the price of a house can never be negative. That would imply that the buyer is being paid a sum of money along with receiving a house, which does not make sense realistically. Pure linear regression takes into account both negative and positive values, which is why we can rule it out. Instead, we truncate our fitting line at \(y=0\), giving us the following that predicts the price as a function of size.</p> <div class="row justify-content-center mt-3"> <div class="col-8 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/housing_example_3.jpg" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/housing_example_3.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> The modified linear regression line with truncation (a.k.a ReLU). </div> <p>This resulting function is known as a <strong>Rectified Linear Unit</strong> or <strong>ReLU</strong> for short, and is widely used in the development of deep learning models.</p> <h5 id="scenario-2">Scenario 2</h5> <p>Now, suppose we have more features to work with in addition to the size of the house, such as the number of <em>bedrooms</em>, <em>zip code</em> and <em>wealth</em> of the neighborhood. In this scenario we can make the following observations:</p> <ul> <li>The <em>size</em> and <em>number of bedrooms</em> gives us an idea of whether a house can accommodate for the <em>family size</em>.</li> <li>The <em>zip code</em> tells us how <em>walkable</em> the locality of the house is.</li> <li>The <em>zip code</em> along with the <em>wealth</em> of the neighborhood can give us an idea of the <em>quality of schools</em> in the area.</li> </ul> <p>All of this information can be visualized in the form of a neural network as shown.</p> <div class="row justify-content-center mt-3"> <div class="col-10 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/housing_example_nn_1.jpg" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/housing_example_nn_1.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>The circles in the image here represent <strong>nodes</strong> which can contain a ReLU or any other function. The arrows here represent the flow of information between the input and nodes.</p> <p>All the observations made above can be seen as functions that take in the information to give the corresponding outputs for family size, walkability and school quality. In a similar fashion, all of these can together be taken in as inputs for yet another node which gives us an estimate for the price of the given house.</p> <p>This example gives us a look into how people can go about deciding how much they would be willing to spend on a house.</p> <h2 id="a-real-world-neural-network">A real-world Neural Network</h2> <p>In a real-world implementation of a neural network, the inputs are taken as a vector \(X\) with the target (price) taken as \(y\) which we aim to predict.</p> <p>We give the neural network the \(X\) values along with the target \(y\) as the training set. As opposed to the previous scenarios, the function of the intermediate layers are figured out by the neural network by itself.</p> <div class="row justify-content-center mt-3"> <div class="col-8 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/actual_nn.jpg" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/actual_nn.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> A real-world implementation of a single layer neural network. </div> <p>A practical neural network would look like the image above. The circles here are called <strong>hidden units</strong> which are arranged in layers known as <strong>hidden layers</strong>.</p> <p>Each node here takes inputs from all of the input features. We do not have control over what each node does. The neural network itself makes the decision on what each node is supposed to do.</p> <p>In addition, a practical neural network will seldom have just one neuron or a single layer. Instead a collection of several neurons receiving differing inputs would be used, which collaborate to give an accurate and complex prediction.</p> <p>In this case, the layer is known as a <strong>densely connected layer</strong> as every input feature of a given layer is connected to every other node in its previous and next layer.</p> <p>The main advantage of neural networks is that with a large enough number of input features along with the target, and enough training examples for them, neural networks are effective at figuring out approximate functions to map the inputs to the outputs.</p> <h2 id="supervised-learning-with-neural-networks">Supervised Learning with Neural Networks</h2> <p>Supervised learning makes use of labelled datasets where we have both the features \(X\) and the target \(y\) available to us. The goal here is to learn a function that would best form a relation ship between them.</p> <p>Neural networks are widely used for supervised learning tasks due to their adaptability and capability of creating complex representations.</p> <p>A popular implementation of neural networks is in Natural Language Processing, where they are used in tasks such as sentiment analysis, machine translation and speech synthesis.</p> <p>Computer Vision is another implementation of neural networks where machines are trained to interpret images and make decisions based on the same. Some popular computer vision tasks are object detection, image recognition and facial recognition.</p> <p>Neural networks also find use in the domain of healthcare <a class="citation" href="#DLNIH">(Miotto, 2018)</a> where they are employed in fields such as biomedical informatics, genomics and public health to gain insights from high dimensional and complex data. Several challenges and opportunities are faced in this field, especially when developing data-driven tools for knowledge discovery and predictive analysis. Neural networks find their use here due to them being capable of creating models to more accurately represent the complex relationships in the data and create meaningful abstractions from it.</p> <h3 id="sequential-data">Sequential Data</h3> <p>A lot of modern implementations of deep learning involves working with <strong>sequential data</strong>. Sequential data refers to a series of data points whose order of occurrence is of importance. Examples of these are time series data, audio signals, stock price data, natural language sentences, gene sequences and weather data. In all these cases, the points in the dataset are dependent on their position in relation to other points present in the dataset.</p> <p>Traditional neural networks are not capable of handling sequential data well as they are incapable of taking into consideration of the sequence in which the data is fed into them. Instead specialized neural networks have been developed to handle these cases, some of which are:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)</strong>: RNNs are designed to work with sequential data. This is attributed to their “memory” mechanism where they can take in information from prior inputs to influence the outcome of the current input and output. As opposed to traditional neural networks which assume the inputs to be independent of each other, RNN outputs depend on the prior elements in the sequence. This makes them useful in fields such as speech recognition and language modelling.</li> <li> <strong>Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks</strong>: LSTMs <a class="citation" href="#LSTM">(Hochreiter &amp; Schmidhuber, 1997)</a> are a variant of RNNs developed as a solution to several problems faced by RNNs such as the vanishing gradient problem. These models can memorize patterns over long sequences, making them useful for time series predictions with longer patterns such as machine translation, speech recognition and video analysis.</li> <li> <strong>Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs)</strong>: GRUs, similar to LSTMs also address the problem of short-term memory in RNNs and simplify the overall architecture of LSTMs.</li> <li> <strong>Transformers and Attention Mechanisms</strong>: These architectures while not being recurrent, handle sequences in the input data by focusing on input elements that are considered important. They prioritize focusing on relevant information, leading to an enhancement of the overall performance of the model.</li> </ul> <h3 id="non-sequential-data">Non-Sequential Data</h3> <p>Non-sequential data is more straightforward to deal with as the inputs are independent of one another. Such information can be modelled with the use of <strong>FeedForward Neural Networks (FNNs)</strong> or <strong>Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLPs)</strong>. These networks are quintessential to deep learning and aim to approximate a function mapping its inputs to the outputs. They consist of an input layer, several hidden layers and an output layer. In these networks the neurons in a given layer are fully connected with the neurons in the subsequent layer, hence enabling the learning and transformation of features. Such networks are used for tasks such as regression and classification and more complex tasks in combination with other techniques.</p> <p>In the subsequent sections we will dive deeper into how these networks work.</p> <h2 id="neural-networks-the-basics">Neural Networks: The Basics</h2> <p><strong>Deep feedforward networks</strong> <a class="citation" href="#Goodfellow-et-al-2016">(Goodfellow et al., 2016)</a> are the most basic of deep learning models with the main goal of approximating a function. Feedforward networks get their name from the flow of information through the function being evaluated from the inputs \(X\), through intermediate computations towards the output \(y\). These intermediate computations eventually define the function we are approximating.</p> <div class="row justify-content-center mt-3"> <div class="col-10 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/DNN1.jpg" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/DNN1.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> A typical feedforward network. </div> <p>Neural networks, as can be seen form the image, compose different functions together. A good example given by Goodfellow’s book (previously cited) takes three functions \(f^{(1)}, f^{(2)}, f^{(3)}\) which are connected in a chain to form a composite function of the form \(f(x) = f^{(3)}(f^{(2)}(f^{(1)}(x)))\), where the numbers in the superscript correspond to different <strong>layers</strong> of nodes. This is what gives us the term <strong>networks</strong> to describe these models.</p> <p>The very first layer of the feedforward network consists of the inputs, aptly giving it the name: the <strong>input layer</strong> with the final layer of the network being called the <strong>output layer</strong>. The layers that lie between the input and output layers are called <strong>hidden layers</strong>.</p> <p>Training a neural network has the aim of finding an approximate function, say \(f(x)\) that can match an unknown function, say \(f^{*}(x)\). The training process of a neural network aims to drive the function \(f(x)\) to match \(f^{*}(x)\) as close as possible. Each training example gives us noisy approximate examples of \(f^{*}(x)\), hence specifying directly what a layer must do at the given point. The training algorithm must decide how the layers are used together towards producing \(f\) such that it is as close as possible to \(f^{*}\).</p> <p>The most common analogy for naming these networks as <strong>neural networks</strong> is that they take inspiration from neuroscience, owing to their resemblance to human neurons. A human neuron receives electrical signals from other neurons, does a simple computation and if fired, it sends a pulse of electricity down the axon to other neurons. Similarly, each layer of a neural network is vector valued, with each vector element representing a neuron and the number of elements representing the <strong>width</strong> of the model.</p> <p>However, it is still up to question how neurons actually work as they are much more complex than the given explanation. We are not sure if a neuron uses an algorithm or any other different learning principle. Hence, deep learning can learn complex function mappings fairly easily, but does not directly compare to a neuron.</p> <p>The easiest way to understand how neural networks work is through examples, one of which we will have a look at now.</p> <h2 id="notation">Notation</h2> <p>Before we go on to building our network, here are some notations to keep in mind that we will be using.</p> <ul> <li>A single training example is \((x,y)\) where \(x \in \mathbb{R}^{n_{x}}\) and \(y \in \{0,1\}\)</li> <li>Training set is denoted by \(m\) or \(m_{train}\) : \(\{(x^{(1)},y^{(1)}), (x^{(2)},y^{(2)}), \dots, (x^{(m)},y^{(m)})\}\)</li> <li>Testing set is denoted by \(m_{test}\)</li> <li>The training set as a column matrix is denoted as \(X = \begin{bmatrix} \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; &amp; \vdots\\ x^{(1)} &amp; x^{(2)} &amp; \dots &amp; x^{(m)}\\ \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; &amp; \vdots\\ \end{bmatrix}\), with the number of columns being \(m\) and the number of training examples/rows/height is \(n_{x}\). \(X \in \mathbb{R}^{n_{x} \times m}\)</li> <li>The output labels are also in the form of a row vector corresponding to each column of \(X\) such that \(Y \in \mathbb{R}^{1 \times m}\).</li> <li>Different layers of the network are denoted with superscript square brackets. For instance, \(z^{[1]}\) and \(a^{[1]}\) correspond to computations on the first layer, \(z^{[2]}\) and \(a^{[2]}\) correspond to computations on the second layer, and so on.</li> </ul> <h2 id="logistic-regression">Logistic Regression</h2> <p>In the modern day, we use a lot of different types of artificial neurons, the most common of which is the <strong>sigmoid neuron</strong>, which is used for binary classification via <strong>logistic regression</strong>.</p> <p>The formula of the sigmoid function is given by the formula</p> \[f = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-\sum\limits\beta_nx_n}}\] <p>where \(\beta_n\) is a <strong>weight</strong> and \(x_n\) is a <strong>feature</strong>.</p> <p>Consider the example of an image that we have to classify as either a cat (1) or not a cat (0). The image is in the form of 3 matrices of red, green and blue channels. So, for a \(64 \times 64\) pixel image, we have 3 \(64 \times 64\) matrices corresponding to rgb pixel intensities for the image.</p> <p>To convert these into a feature vector, we unroll the matrices into an input feature \(x\) as</p> \[\begin{bmatrix} 255\\ 231\\ \vdots\\ 255\\ 134\\ \end{bmatrix}\] <p>which is a combination of all the rgb pixel intensity values into a single vector.</p> <p>For a \(64 \times 64\) image, the dimension of this vector will be \(64 \times 64 \times 3\) as it is the total number of elements we have which in this case is 12288. We use \(n_{x}= 12288\) to represent <strong>dimension of input features</strong> \(x\) and sometimes for brevity we just use \(n\).</p> <p>The goal here is to use an input image represented by the feature vector \(x\) to predict whether the corresponding label \(y\) is 1 or 0.</p> <p>Now, given the input images \(X\) we want to predict \(\hat{y} = P(y=1 \mid x)\).</p> <p>Here the <strong>parameters</strong> we work with are:</p> <ul> <li>The <strong>weights</strong>, \(w \in \mathbb{R}^{n_{x}}\), which are vectors and</li> <li>The <strong>biases</strong>, \(b \in \mathbb{R}\), which are scalars.</li> </ul> <p>This, is the basis of a <strong>linear model</strong> given by</p> \[\hat{y} = w^{T}x + b\] <p>The dot product of \(w^T\) and \(x\) helps us evaluate multiple classifiers parallelly where each \(x\) would have a different value of \(w\).</p> <p>The drawback of a linear classifier is the fact that it has a range of values in \((-\infty, +\infty)\), giving us output values that have a large amount of variations as opposed to a simple yes or no equivalent.</p> <p>This is where logistic regression comes in. The logistic function</p> \[\hat{y} = \sigma(\underbrace{w^{T}x + b}_{z}) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}\] <p>clamps the value of the linear function within the range \([0,1]\) such that</p> <ul> <li>for very large values of \(z\), \(e^{-z} \rightarrow 0\), hence giving us \(\sigma(z) \approx 1\)</li> <li>for very large negative values of \(z\), \(e^{-z} \rightarrow \infty\), hence giving us \(\sigma(z) \approx 0\)</li> </ul> <p>Our goal here is to learn the parameters \(w\) and \(b\) such that the given function \(\hat{y}\) is a good estimate of \(P(y=1 \mid x)\). This is done with the help of the <strong>cost function</strong>.</p> <h2 id="cost-functions">Cost Functions</h2> <p>We already know loss functions to be the measure the performance of an individual training example. The <strong>cost function</strong> is the average of the loss functions over the entire training set. Cost functions measure how well the parameters are doing over the entire set. The main goal is to minimize the cost function with the help of the appropriate weights and biases.</p> <p>When designing a neural network, the choice of cost function we use holds a great deal of importance. Cost functions in the case of neural networks are the same as those of other models parametric models.</p> <p>The most common parametric models we use define a distribution, which work on the idea of maximum likelihood, hence making use of cross-entropy between the training data and predictions as the cost function (such as is in the case of logistic regression or softmax).</p> <p>In practice, when training a neural network, the total cost function would be a combination of the primary cost function with a regularization term.</p> <h3 id="logistic-regression-cost-function">Logistic Regression Cost Function</h3> <p>Consider the data points \(\{(x^{(1)},y^{(1)}), (x^{(2)},y^{(2)}), \dots, (x^{(m)},y^{(m)})\}\), where we want to find \(\hat{y}^{(i)} \approx y^{((i))}\). the function being taken here is the sigmoid function given by \(\hat{y} = \sigma(w^{T}x + b)\) or</p> \[\sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}\] <p>by finding the parameters \(w\) &amp; \(b\).</p> <p>We judge the performance of our model by using an <strong>error/loss function</strong> denoted by \(L(\hat{y}, y)\). The loss function here helps us understand how well our current approximating function’s output \(\hat{y}\) is doing in comparison to the ground truth \(y\).</p> <p>In most cases, the <strong>square error</strong> or <strong>half of the square error</strong> would be taken into consideration for a linear problem. In the case of Logistic Regression, the optimization problem would be non-convex with multiple local minima if we made use of this loss function.</p> <p>Hence, instead we make used of the loss function for Logistic regression, given by</p> \[L(\hat{y}, y) = -(y\log{\hat{y}} + (1-y)\log{ (1-\hat{y})})\] <p>For squared error, we normally want the value to be as small as possible. Similarly for logistic regression, we would want this loss function to be as small as possible.</p> <p>The mechanism of this loss function is rather interesting to look at. It is a version of <strong>Cross-Entropy Loss</strong> which is used to calculate the loss for the softmax function, which we will look into later on. Its working is as follows</p> <ul> <li>Take \(y=1\), then we get \(L(\hat{y}, y) = -\log{\hat{y}}\), which should be as small as possible. <ul> <li>This means that \(\log{\hat{y}}\) should be as large as possible.</li> <li>And hence \(\hat{y}\) should be large but never bigger than 1.</li> </ul> </li> <li>On the flip side, if \(y=0\), then we would get \(L(\hat{y}, y) = -\log{(1-\hat{y})}\), which should be as small as possible. <ul> <li>\(\log{(1-\hat{y})}\) should be as large as possible.</li> <li>hence \(\hat{y}\) should be as small as possible but never lesser than 0.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>If we are working with the complete training set, instead of a loss function, we would make use of the <strong>cost function</strong> given by</p> \[J(w,b) = \frac{1}{m}\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} L(\hat{y}^{(i)}, y^{(i)}) = -\frac{1}{m}\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} y^{(i)}\log{\hat{y}^{(i)}} + (1-y^{(i)})\log{(1-\hat{y}^{(i)})}\] <p>where we want to find \(w\) and \(b\) such that it minimizes the overall cost function \(J(w,b)\). We will be looking into the mechanism for this now.</p> <h2 id="gradient-descent">Gradient Descent</h2> <p>As opposed to most models we usually see in machine learning, neural networks are non-linear, leading to the loss functions being non-convex. Hence, neural networks need to be trained iteratively using gradient based optimizers to drive the cost function low as possible.</p> <p>Gradient descent is one of the most common algorithms used in machine learning, and in this case, it also finds its use in learning the parameters \(w\) and \(b\) on our training set.</p> <p>When training neural networks using gradient descent, it is important that all the weights are initialized to small random values with the biases being either zero or small positive values. We will look into the reason for this later in this article.</p> <p>Gradient descent can be visualized as shown</p> <div class="row justify-content-center mt-3"> <div class="col-8 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/Gradient%20Descent.png" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/Gradient%20Descent.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>The cost function here is seen as a surface above the horizontal axes of \(w\) and \(b\) with the height giving us the value of \(J(w,b)\) at a certain point.</p> <p>We aim to find the value of \(w\) and \(b\) such that the cost of our resultant model corresponds with the minimum of this curve.

An operation can only return a single output variable.</p> <h2 id="forward-propagation">Forward Propagation</h2> <p>The process of computing the output of a neural network is done through <strong>forward propagation</strong>. This process is similar to logistic regression but repeated for each node in the hidden layer.</p> <p>Neural networks, as discussed before, can be seen as multiple functions stacked together as multiple layers of computations.

It is a gradient descent method used to minimize the error in the predictions of our network, which it does so by adjusting the weights and biases.</p> <p>Backpropagation allows for the backward flow of information throughout the network, helping us compute the gradient.</p> <p>The process of backward propagation is as follows:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Forward Pass</strong>: This is the first step in the backprop process where the input data is passed through the layers of the network, going through all the hidden layers to get an output prediction.</li> <li> <strong>Loss Calculation</strong>: Upon receiving the output predictions, we can compare it with the ground truth by taking the difference between them via a loss function.</li> <li> <strong>Backward Pass</strong>: This is the main backpropagation step where the errors are calculated, passed through the network, and eventually used to update the weights and biases through gradient descent. Here: <ul> <li>The error obtained is used to calculate the partial derivatives (gradients) of the loss/cost function with respect to the weights \(w\) and biases \(b\).</li> </ul> </li> <li> <strong>Updating the Weights and Biases</strong>: The gradients calculated are propagated backwards through the network starting from the output, throughout the hidden layers. This is usually done by gradient descent, or other similar optimization parameters. <ul> <li>As the errors are being propagated, the parameters at each node are updated according to how much they contribute towards the total loss. The gradients calculated tell us how much a change in the given parameter contribute towards the total loss.</li> <li>The adjusting of the parameters is done in the opposite direction of gradient so as to reduce the error obtained.</li> <li>A <strong>learning rate</strong> hyperparameter (\(\alpha\)) is used to control how much the parameters are being updated by at each step of backpropagation.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <strong>Iteration</strong>: The steps above are repeated until we either the error stops reducing significantly or the loop reaches the maximum number of predefined iterations.</li> </ul> <h3 id="importance-of-backpropagation">Importance of Backpropagation</h3> <ul> <li>Backpropagation is efficient due to its calculating the gradient, directly informing the network of how the parameters should be adjusted to reduce the error.</li> <li>Backpropagation can be applied to any differentiable loss function and network architecture. This is known as universality.</li> </ul> <h3 id="challenges-faced-in-backpropagation">Challenges faced in Backpropagation</h3> <p>Some common challenges faced during the backpropagation process are:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Vanishing and Exploding gradients</strong>: These are some of the most common problems faced during backpropagation. These occur when the gradients of the weights and biases become either too small or too large as they propagate through the network, making the learning process slow or unstable respectively. These are caused by various factors such as the choice of activation function, parameter initialization or depth of the network.</li> <li> <strong>Local Minima</strong>: This is another challenge faced during backprop, where the model gets stuck in a local minimum or saddle point of the loss function. These prevent the network from reaching the optimal solution. These can be combated by using techniques such as momentum, AdamProp, or adaptive learning rates.</li> <li> <strong>Computational complexity</strong>: Backpropagation can turn out to be computationally expensive or lead to issues with memory limitations due to the need for storing and updating values and gradients of all the parameters and activations. This limits how complex we can make our network and the quality of the data we can use for training. For this we use techniques like mini-batch training, pruning and quantization.</li> <li> <strong>Overfitting and Underfitting</strong>: This is an issue that is faced both in the sphere of deep learning and traditional machine learning. Both these problems lead to poor performance and accuracy of the network.

This is rightfully so as deep learning, though still being a bit rough around the edges have demonstrated superior performance in several fields of application.</p> <p>While we know that deep learning models work well, we need to first understand whether a given problem warrants the use of such an architecture. It is always a good practice to first use simpler models like decision trees, logistic regression or networks with a few layers before moving on to more complex and deep architectures.</p> <h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1> <p>In this article, we have seen how deep artificial neural networks work from the ground up, gaining an understanding of the underlying mathematics and how they have the potential to learn increasingly complex functions, hence finding a great deal of use in several fields.</p> <p>Now that we have these concepts down, it would be good to know how the training process for more complex neural networks would work.
