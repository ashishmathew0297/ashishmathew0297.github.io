Such implementations require completely different architectures, concepts and implementations, and, as has been discussed before, intuitions for these domains do not always cross pollinate.</p> <p>This blog will cover one such domain that has been of great interest to me for the longest time: <strong>Computer Vision</strong>. A lot of the content of this blog is based off papers written by the original authors with the main structure of the blog being highly inspired by the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks?specialization=deep-learning" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Convolutional Neural Networks</a> portion of the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Deep Learning Specialization</a> by Andrew Ng. The images in this blog were either made by hand, in <a href="https://app.diagrams.net/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">draw.io</a>, taken from their respective research papers, or were generated through python. Without wasting any more time, let’s begin.</p> <hr> <h1 id="what-is-computer-vision">What is Computer Vision?</h1> <p>Computer Vision (CV) is one of the most intuitive and rapidly advancing fields of deep learning in the modern day. The basic idea of computer vision is to allow devices to be able to observe and identify images and/or aspects of images and videos, trying to mimic how a human’s ocular nervous system would do the same.</p> <p>As groundbreaking as it is, it would surprise you to know that computer vision research is not as novel as one would think it to be. The ideas have been around since the early 60s, with the first foray into this field being through neurophysical <a class="citation" href="#Hoffmann1984">(Hoffmann &amp; Von Seelen, 1984)</a> experimentation son cats. It is even more intriguing to know that the ideas that worked towards bringing about the discussion of AI stems from the ideas of mechanical autonomy and intelligent machines almost 3000 years ago. Homer’s Odyssey is a prime example of literature at the time that brushes upon the idea of intelligent machines <a class="citation" href="#Lively2020">(Liveley &amp; Thomas, 2020)</a>.</p> <p>Finding use in several domains such as medical imaging, autonomous vehicles, quality control and augmented reality, the rapid advancements in computer vision have pushed us towards new horizons that we would never have fathomed before. Some popular implementations of computer vision are as follows:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Image Recognition</strong>: Image recognition is one of the most common computer vision problems. This classification problem involves training specifically designed neural network models on several examples of labelled image inputs, learning different aspects of it, with the end goal of determining the identity of new and unknown examples.</li> <li> <strong>Object Detection</strong>: Image recognition and object detection are similar techniques but differ completely in their applications. While image recognition identifies an object in an image, object detection is used to detect and locate instances of objects in sample images or videos. Here, the models create bounding boxes at the position and boundaries of the objects we want to detect. Image recognition is often used alongside object detection in several applications.</li> <li> <strong>Image Segmentation</strong>: Image segmentation can be seen as a more refined form of object detection and image classification. Here, the models process the visual data in the image at a pixel level. Classical image segmentation methods take into account the heuristics of the pixels in the image such as the color, position, and intensity. These are used in neural networks to generate more sophisticated results. The outputs of segmentation are segmentation masks which act as pixel-to-pixel boundaries around the objects’ shape for each class of object being identified.</li> </ul> <p>There are several other applications of computer vision in addition to the above, with neural style transfer, autonomous vehicles, augmented reality and facial recognition being just a few of their implementations.</p> <h1 id="convolutional-neural-networks">Convolutional Neural Networks</h1> <h2 id="foundations-of-convolutional-neural-networks">Foundations of Convolutional Neural Networks</h2> <p>The main issue that computer vision problems pose when using normal deep neural networks is the fact that, as the dimensions of the images being used increases, the number of input features we will have to deal with becomes proportionally larger.</p> <p>As a result it is difficult to get enough data to prevent overfitting. In addition, this will also lead to a large computational requirement when training the network.</p> <p>The solution for this is the <strong>convolution operation</strong>. This is the most building block of a significant number of computer vision models, also known as <strong>convolutional neural networks (CNNs)</strong>.</p> <h2 id="the-convolution-operation">The Convolution Operation</h2> <p>The best explanations of the convolution operation in signal processing that I have seen are from this video by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">3Blue1Brown</a>.</p> <div class="row mt-1"> <div class="col-sm mt-1 mt-md-0"> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KuXjwB4LzSA?si=ozem701wKPFMVaac" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </div> </div> <p><br></p> <p>There are several ways of picturing what a convolution is and how it works. It even ties into moving averages which was discussed in the <a href="/blog/2024/deep-learning-self-study-2/">previous blog</a>.</p> <p>The official formulaic definition for the convolution of two different functions is as follows</p> \[(f*g)(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x)g(t-x)\] <p>However this formula tends to scare off most people who do not know what is going on exactly. This is where different intuitions on this help.</p> <p>We will be looking at convolutions from the standpoint of computer vision, where they play the role of filtering images for various uses such as smoothing, sharpening, denoising or detecting edges. This is done so with the help of a convolution <strong>filter</strong> or <strong>kernel</strong> which moves across the pixels in the image, multiplying the values and adding them up, giving us a different version of the same image.</p> <h2 id="an-intuition-vertical-edge-detection">An intuition: Vertical Edge Detection</h2> <p>As has been mentioned before, the good way to understand how convolution works is in the field of computer vision, through the example of a <strong>filter</strong>.</p> <p>In this case we are making use of an edge detector, specifically a vertical edge detector, which we will look at after this section.</p> <p>Consider a \(6\times 6\) greyscale image, which is effectively a 2 dimensional matrix of dimensions \((6,6,1)\) as shown below</p> \[\begin{bmatrix} 3 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 7 &amp; 4 \\ 1 &amp; 5 &amp; 8 &amp; 9 &amp; 3 &amp; 1 \\ 2 &amp; 7 &amp; 2 &amp; 5 &amp; 1 &amp; 3 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 3 &amp; 1 &amp; 7 &amp; 8 \\ 4 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 6 &amp; 2 &amp; 8 \\ 2 &amp; 4 &amp; 5 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 9 \\ \end{bmatrix}\] <p>For this image we, will be applying a vertical edge detection filter which is of the form</p> \[\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 \\ 1 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 \\ 1 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 \\ \end{bmatrix}\] <p>to it. The convolving setup is as follows.</p> \[\begin{bmatrix} 3 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 7 &amp; 4 \\ 1 &amp; 5 &amp; 8 &amp; 9 &amp; 3 &amp; 1 \\ 2 &amp; 7 &amp; 2 &amp; 5 &amp; 1 &amp; 3 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 3 &amp; 1 &amp; 7 &amp; 8 \\ 4 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 6 &amp; 2 &amp; 8 \\ 2 &amp; 4 &amp; 5 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 9 \\ \end{bmatrix} * \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 \\ 1 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 \\ 1 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 \\ \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} * &amp; * &amp; * &amp; * \\ * &amp; * &amp; * &amp; * \\ * &amp; * &amp; * &amp; * \\ * &amp; * &amp; * &amp; * \\ \end{bmatrix}\] <p>where the output is a \(4 \times 4\) array or image.</p> <p>Now, we want to apply the convolution to the image with the given filter, the computation process of which is as follows:</p> <p>We first perform the convolution on the upper left corner of the image by pasting the given \(3 \times 3\) filter on the upper left \(3 \times 3\) region of the original input image.

In most cases, these values are treated as parameters which are automatically learnt through the backpropagation process.</p> <p>In many cases the filters learned by the networks by themselves are much more robust than any predefined filters that we may have.</p> <h2 id="padding">Padding</h2> <p>When building neural networks, one of the modifications we have to make to our images is called <strong>padding</strong>.</p> <p>When performing convolutions on our input images, the dimensions of the output images are reduced with every layer of the neural network.</p> <p>For example, a \(6 \times 6\) image being convolved with a \(3 \times 3\) filter gives us a \(4 \times 4\) output image.</p> <p>Extrapolating this operation to different examples, for a \(n \times n\) image being convolved with a \(f \times f\) filter, the output would have the following dimensions.</p> \[\boxed{(n-f+1) \times (n-f+1)}\] <p>The downsides here are:</p> <ul> <li>Every convolution operation will lead to the image dimensions shrinking</li> <li>The pixels at the corners of the image are not given as much of an importance as a pixel in the middle as the kernel only acts on it once. As a result, the corner pixels contribute much less to the output.</li> </ul> <p>To combat this, padding is implemented before each convolutional operation.</p> <p>The convention followed is to pad the image with layers of pixels \(p\) with the value of \(0\) around the image, changing its dimensions from \(n \times n\) to \((n + 2p) \times (n + 2p)\).</p> <p>The output resulting from convolutions being performed on this image will be</p> \[\boxed{(n+2p-f+1) \times (n+2p-f+1)}\] <p>Increasing the number of layers when padding the image ensures that the corner pixels are utilized more in the outputs.</p> <h2 id="valid-and-same-convolutions">Valid and Same Convolutions</h2> <p>A <strong>valid</strong> convolution is one where no padding has been done to the input images</p> \[(n \times n) * (f \times f) \rightarrow (n-f+1) \times (n-f+1)\] <p>A <strong>same</strong> convolution means that the image has been padded such that the size of the output is the same as the size of the input</p> \[\begin{align*} &amp; (n+2p-f+1) \times (n+2p-f+1) = (n \times n) \\ \Rightarrow &amp; p = \frac{f-1}{2} \end{align*}\] <p><strong>By convention, the value of \(f\) is always odd</strong></p> <p>An even filter size would require uneven padding.

We yet again face the same issue as before as the loss value later into the network do not inform the layers much about the inputs as their own inputs are noise. Hence, the gradients are also effectively scrambled and propagate noise back towards the input layers, even compounding it due to multiplications with weight matrices.</p> <p>This leads to a lot of problems when training the network as the backprop algorithm struggles to learn from the inputs.

The effects of this would have are:</p> <ul> <li> <p>For the plain model, the output activation \(A^{[l+2]}\) would be set to a value biased towards zero as opposed to a value that would be more representative of the previous inputs. Hence, the nodes in the given layer would take a longer time to train and also have a lower accuracy.</p> </li> <li> <p>In the case of ResNets, we focus on building information on top of the “identity” formed by pre-existing layers of the network. So, instead of being shrunk to zero, the given layer’s output would consist of the additional information, or “residuals” learned by the layers in between the skip layers and the output.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The idea is that if we have a shallower model learning a function, we should also be able to train a deeper model to learn the same function by copying the original five layers’ values and using the additional layers to learn residuals that are added on top of the identity function.</p> <p>The plain model does not learn the identity function because most of the weights are initialiized close to zero, hence causing any sort of regularization to bias the weights towards zero.</p> <p>Hence, the idea of identity functions makes it easy for our residual blocks to train, making it so that adding the additional layers to the network will not have as much of an impact on its ability to learn.</p> <h4 id="note">Note</h4> <p>When building ResNets it is assumed that the dimensions of the skip connection and the output of the residual block have the same dimension.</p> <p>Hence, we <strong>must</strong> use same convolutions in the residual network with \(1 \times 1\) strides to ensure the same input and output dimensions.</p> <p>In the occasion that the dimensions are different, we must add a matrix \(W_{s}\) to transform the dimensions of the output to be the same as the input.</p> <p>Here, \(W_{s}\) can be a set of parameters to be learned or a matrix that implements zero padding.</p> <p>If we also want to match up the number of channels, we use \(1 \times 1\) convolutions.</p> <h2 id="advantages-of-resnets">Advantages of ResNets</h2> <h5 id="1-skip-blocks-augment-the-existing-data">1. Skip blocks augment the existing data</h5> <p>As the skip connection passes the input down to the later layers of the neural network, the main network can focus on figuring out what information it has to add on top of the inputs as opposed to the whole input itself. This makes subsequent processing easier.</p> <ul> <li>If we are concatenating the inputs, it is passed through unchanged along with the outputs. If added, the value being sent is mostly unchanged as the weights are centered around zero.</li> <li>As a result of this each block learns a simpler task and has better access to information to learn from.</li> </ul> <h5 id="2-shorter-gradient-paths">2. Shorter gradient paths</h5> <p>Due to skip connections, the gradients have shorter paths to follow to get to each layer of the network. This is because each block has one path going through each of the layers and one path around them, and the gradients go back through both of them. Hence, any layer in the network will have a shorter path which the loss gradients can arrive to and usefully update the given layer’s computation</p> <ul> <li>As a result, in the initial epochs when the training results are not informative, we can still get useful updates from the shorter paths and obtain decreasing loss right away.</li> <li>In addition, over time, as the later blocks in the network start computing more useful functions, the information along the direct path becomes more informative, hence leading to a continued decrease in the gradients, outperforming the plain network.</li> <li>To sum it up, this leads to <strong>faster training</strong>.</li> </ul> <h5 id="3-modularity">3. Modularity</h5> <p>An additional advantage that ResNets have is modularity. Since each of the blocks have similar structures, we can short circuit around blocks during training, making it easier to add more blocks and deepen the network.</p> <ul> <li>Most papers have variations on the same network with different numbers of blocks with different tradeoffs between the resources needed to train and the resulting model’s predicting power.</li> </ul> <h2 id="concerns">Concerns</h2> <h5 id="1-shape-mismatch">1. Shape Mismatch</h5> <p>If we want to combine the inputs and outputs of a ResNet, we need to ensure that the input and output shapes match up. For normal activation layers like dense networks, we might end up with different numbers of neurons per layer.</p> <p>Hence, when adding the inputs to the outputs of the first block, we need an operation to reshape the inputs or only add the inputs to a part of the block’s output.</p> <p>With ConvNets, we will have to ensure that the height and width of the convolutional layers can be combined with the input height and width.</p> <h5 id="2-parameter-explosion">2. Parameter Explosion</h5> <p>Another concern with ResNets is that with repeated concatenation at the output blocks, we can get a large activation tensor, hence leading to an explosion in the number of parameters. To counteract this, we prefer using addition to concatenation with matching input shapes.</p> <h1 id="shape-matching-convolutional-blocks">Shape Matching Convolutional blocks</h1> <p>A lot of implementations of ConvNets require for us to ensure that the output shapes of convolutional blocks are in a particular shape. One way to ensure this is to use \(1 \times 1\) strides and same padding to ensure the width and height of the image are preserved.</p> <p>However, if we want to match up the number of channels, we use \(1 \times 1\) convolutions.</p> <h1 id="1-times-1-convolutions-networks-in-networks">\(1 \times 1\) Convolutions (Networks in Networks)</h1> <p>\(1 \times 1\) convolutions are useful when designing ConvNet architectures.</p> <p>A \(1 \times 1\) filter would be something like</p> \[\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 6 &amp; 5 &amp; 8 \\ 3 &amp; 5 &amp; 5 &amp; 1 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 \\ 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 9 &amp; 3 \\ 4 &amp; 7 &amp; 8 &amp; 5 &amp; 7 &amp; 9 \\ 1 &amp; 5 &amp; 3 &amp; 7 &amp; 4 &amp; 8 \\ 5 &amp; 4 &amp; 9 &amp; 8 &amp; 3 &amp; 5 \\ \end{bmatrix} * \begin{bmatrix} 2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 2 &amp; 4 &amp; 6 &amp; \dots &amp; &amp; \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \end{bmatrix}\] <p>Here we are effectively multiplying every pixel of the given image by \(2\).</p> <p>For a \(6 \times 6 \times 32\) image, the filter goes through each of the \(36\) pixels of the image, taking the element-wise product with the \(32\) pixels in the same position along the channels, hence giving us a real number output to which we apply our non-linearities.</p> <p>This is equivalent to a single neuron with \(32\) nodes, multiplying each of them in place with \(32\) weights, adding them up and applying our non-linearity to them.</p> <p>For multiple filters. it is equivalent to having multiple units, taking all the numbers in a slice and building them up to an output.</p> <p>This is called a \(1 \times 1\) convolution or network in network.</p> <h3 id="alternate-explanation">Alternate explanation</h3> <p>Using a \(1 \times 1\) kernel on a multi-channel input gives an output block with the same height and width as the input. Each neuron in the output receives inputs from just one pixel of the input but also receives information from the entire depth of the particular channel it is pointed to.</p> <p>Setting the number of filters helps us specify the depth of the output, and each neuron of the output can gets its inputs from the neurons across the depth of the previous layer. This is similar to adding a single dense layer to make the input and output shapes match up.</p> <h2 id="uses-of-1-times-1-convolutions">Uses of \(1 \times 1\) convolutions</h2> <p>Consider the given case below</p> \[28 \times 28 \times 192 \xrightarrow[CONV 1 \times 1 \;\; (32)]{ReLU} 28 \times 28 \times 32\] <p>To shrink the height and width of the volume above we would normally use a pooling layer, but we have no straightforward way to reduce the number of channels.</p> <p>Hence, in this case, to shrink the number of filters down to \(32\), we use \(32\) \(1 \times 1\) filters with each filter having a dimensions of \(1 \times 1 \times 192\).

A layer by layer construction is followed where correlation statistics of the previous layer are analyzed and grouped into units with high correlation.</p> <p>These groups/clusters are then used as units for the next layer and are connected to the units of the previous layer.</p> <p>Using the same example as before, we could make a composition of the form</p> <ul> <li>A \(1 \times 1\) convolution to give a \(28 \times 2 \times 64\) output.</li> <li>A \(3 \times 3\) same convolution to give a \(28 \times 28 \times 128\) output.</li> <li>A \(5 \times 5\) same convolution to give a \(28 \times 28 \times 32\) output.</li> <li>A max pooling layer with padding to give us a \(28 \times 28 \times 32\) output.</li> </ul> <p>And then repeat this structure multiple times as per our need.</p> <p>As the inception modules are stacked, the output correlation statistics will vary as features with higher abstraction are captured deep into the network. This leads to lesser spatial concentration and as a result, the computations become much more expensive. Max pooling, when added to the mix, leads to an increase in the number of outputs at each stage.</p> <p>To combat this, <strong>dimension reduction</strong> is practiced at points where computational requirements go high. This is done with the help of \(1 \times 1\) convolutions before the more expensive \(3 \times 3\) and \(5 \times 5\) convolutions. The resultant inception models are as follows.</p> <div class="row justify-content-center mt-3"> <div class="col-8 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/naive_inception.png" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/naive_inception.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Source, "Going Deeper With Convolutions" (Szegedy et al., 2014) </div> <div class="row justify-content-center mt-3"> <div class="col-8 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/dimension_reduced_inception.png" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/dimension_reduced_inception.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Source, "Going Deeper With Convolutions" (Szegedy et al., 2014) </div> <p>Hence, as a result we have a network architecture that alows us to build deep models without an increase in computational complexity and, in addition, allows visual information to be processed at various scales and aggregated so that the next layers can abstract features from them parallelly.</p> <h4 id="googlenet">GoogLeNet</h4> <p>GoogLeNet made use of this Inception architecture to perform well under strict memory and computational budget, using only 5 million parameters, as opposed to AlexNet and VGGNet.</p> <p>The resultant neural network architecture that was proposed by the team using these inception modules is shown below.</p> <div class="row justify-content-center mt-3"> <div class="col-12 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/googleNet.jpg" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/googleNet.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Source, "Going Deeper With Convolutions" (Szegedy et al., 2014) </div> <p>As we can see here, there are two extra “auxillary networks” added to the architecture here aside from the inception layers.

The main question this paper poses is:</p> <blockquote> <p>Is there a principled method to scale up ConvNets that can achieve better accuracy and efficiency?</p> </blockquote> <p>The authors of this paper proposed a <em>compound scaling method</em> where the various dimensions of the network, namely the</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Width</strong> of the layers</li> <li> <strong>Depth</strong> of the layers</li> <li> <strong>Resolution</strong> of tje images were uniformly scaled by fixed ratios as opposed to arbitrary scales.</li> </ul> <p>So, based on the resources available, these dimensions would have to be scaled up based on a grid search using the initial model.</p> <p>This compound scaling method is used on already existing networks like MobileNet and ResNets to obtain the <strong>EfficientNet</strong> family of models, which outperform other ConvNets by a large margin.</p> <h1 id="using-convnets-in-the-real-world">Using ConvNets in the Real World</h1> <h2 id="using-open-source-implementations-of-cnn-architectures">Using Open Source Implementations of CNN Architectures</h2> <p>Most of the CNN architectures discussed here are finnicky to work with and difficult to replicate as they involve a ton of hyperparameter tuning which can affect the performance. I addition they also implement several tricks to ensure a high amount of efficiency on different CPU/GPU architectures. Due to this, in most cases it wouldn’t even make sense to implement these from scratch unless you’re masochistic to a certain extent.</p> <p>It is a good idea to use open source implementations from sources like GitHub, and Huggingface to build up on already existing work. This helps us get going with our ideas much faster than if we were to implement these from scratch.</p> <h2 id="implementing-transfer-learning">Implementing Transfer Learning</h2> <p>There has been loads of work done in the field of computer vision, due to which there is always a chance that someone has already pre-trained a model to perform a task similar to what you are working on. Like for instance, if we look at AlexNet, its uses aren’t fixed just to identify stuff from the ImageNet dataset. It has been widely used in several domains of research and development.</p> <p>The weights and biases of a pre-trained model, owing to the predefined patterns learned from the previous datasets trained on, can now be trained on our current data to suit our use case. This is known as <strong>transfer learning</strong> and is widely used to help reduce computational costs.</p> <p>In most cases the pretrained model has the original output classifier layer replaced with the softmax classifier for the current use case and trained a bit till the desired level of accuracy is obtained.</p> <p>For larger datasets, it is not as straightforward. We would need to freeze some of the lower layer values and only focus on training the later layers in the network. The larger the amount of data we have, the more the number of later layers we will have to train. In the case of a massive dataset, the whole network implementation itself with the pre-trained weights and biases can be used as the initialization (If you notice, this is a stand in for random initialization) and the whole network can be trained using these.</p> <h2 id="data-augmentation">Data Augmentation</h2> <p>CV tasks require a lot of data owing to the complexity of the functions that need to be learned. In a lot of cases, it is not easy to procure new data from our sources. Hence, this is where data augmentation comes into the picture to help improve the CV system.</p> <p>Some common data augmentation methods used in computer vision are</p> <ul> <li>Mirroring on the vertical axis</li> <li>Random cropping of the input images (assuming that the croppings are a reasonably large subset of the parent image)</li> <li>Rotation, shearing, local warping, etc.</li> <li>Color shifting: adding/subtracting to and from the RGB color channels of the image. These changes can be from a miniscule distribution of possible values. This makes the algorithm more robust to changes in color of the images. <ul> <li>PCA color augmentation is one method used and has been implemented in AlexNet.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>These all have their own set of hyperparameters to choose from.</p> <h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1> <p>In this blogpost we have been introduced to the basic mathematical and architectural concepts behind a lot of famous computer vision applications, their implementations, and all the innovations and improvements that have been made on them over the years. All the concepts covered here are only just scratching the surface when it comes to this field of study. Computer vision is a really nuanced field with several subdomains that are actively being researched, and we have delved a bit into one of the domains here, image recognition.</p> <p>In the following blog posts we will cover object detection, which is another subdomain of computer vision which is often paired with image recognition for various real-world applications.</p> </div> </article> <h2>References</h2> <div class="publications"> <h2 class="bibliography">2024</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">AlexNet</abbr> </div> <div id="BruntonResNets" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Residual Networks (ResNet)</div> <div class="author"> Steve Brunton </div> <div class="periodical"> 2024 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="bibtex btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Bib</a> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@online</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">BruntonResNets</span><span class="p">,</span>
